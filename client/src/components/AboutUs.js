			<h1>Our History</h1>
			<p>
				Throughout the course of the class we have been learning how to work with group members to create
				web applications. Around the beginning of April we we're assigned with the task of implementing a full stack application
				inside of our new group environment.
			</p>

			<h1>Our Mission</h1>
			<p>
				To create a MERN application within a three week time span. We needed to implement CRUD operations 
				as well as creating a fresh application that could be used in our daily lives.
			</p>

			<h1>Our Vision</h1>
			<p>
				Create an application that would function as a task management tool. This application would be able to organize
				the users workspaces as well as create and update task items.
